# Project Context — Starter Template

Keep this file short (ideally 3–12 bullet points). The goal is to give the
assistant focused, high-signal information that should always be considered
before answering user queries.

- Project name: <replace-with-name>
- Purpose: One-line summary of what the project does
- Primary languages/frameworks: e.g. Python 3.11, FastAPI, React 18
- Important entrypoints: e.g. `src/main.py`, `api/` directory, `server/`
- Coding conventions: e.g. "Use black/flake8", "Follow semantic versioning"
- Test command: e.g. `pytest` or `npm test`
- Known constraints: e.g. "Runs on ARM only", "Depends on internal API X"
- Privacy note: "Do not expose secrets or keys. Redact all secrets."

Usage tips:

- Keep statements declarative and concise.
- Prefer lists and short code references over long prose.
- Update this file when project goals or constraints change.
